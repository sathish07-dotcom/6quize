# Quiz App - JavaScript Project

## Description

This is a simple interactive **Quiz App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to take a quiz, see the correct answers, and get their final score at the end. It provides a user-friendly interface and uses basic JavaScript to handle logic, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users can answer multiple-choice questions with one correct answer.
- **Score Tracking**: The app tracks how many answers are correct and displays the final score.
- **Question Timer**: (Optional) A timer can be set to challenge users on answering within a time limit.
- **Styled Interface**: The app has a clean and responsive design to enhance user experience.
- **Immediate Feedback**: After submitting each answer, users are shown whether they were correct or incorrect.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure and content.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for functionality and dynamic behavior.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-app.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the quiz.

3. The quiz will present a series of questions. For each question, select your answer and click "Next" to move on to the next question.

4. At the end of the quiz, your score will be displayed based on the number of correct answers.

## Features to Explore

- **Adding More Questions**: You can easily modify the JavaScript file to add new questions or change existing ones.
- **Changing the Theme**: Feel free to customize the colors and fonts in the `styles.css` to suit your design preferences.
- **Timer**: If you want to add a countdown timer for each question, you can do so by modifying the JavaScript code to include a timer for each question and penalty for late answers.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder and double-click on `index.html`.
3. The app should load in your default browser, and you're ready to begin.

## Code Structure

Here is a brief overview of the code structure:

```
/quiz-app
├── index.html            # Main HTML file
├── styles.css            # Styling for the quiz interface
└── script.js             # JavaScript file that contains app logic
```

## Customizing the App

- **Adding New Questions**: Questions are stored as objects in an array in `script.js`. You can add new questions by simply following the existing format.
  
  ```javascript
  const questions = [
    {
      question: "What is the capital of France?",
      options: ["Berlin", "Madrid", "Paris", "Rome"],
      correctAnswer: 2
    },
    // Add more questions here
  ];
  ```

- **Modifying the Timer**: You can customize the timer settings by adjusting the code in the `script.js` file.
